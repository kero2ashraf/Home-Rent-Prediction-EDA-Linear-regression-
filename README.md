In this simple project ,i am talking about home rent prediction , what does it mean ?
if i want to buy a home that has area and i want to predict its price  , that`s the summary

python packages :
1) numpy
2) pandas
3) matplotlib.pyplot
4) seaborn
5) from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
6) from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error
7) from sklearn import preprocessing

questions :
1) Give an overview about the data ( cleaning and statistical summary)?
2) Make a plot between area and the rent ?
3) Make a scatter plot and regplot to see the correlation between them?
4) Make a heatmap that shows the correlation?
5) Make a machine learning model using linear regression?
6) predict the price of a home whose area = 3000?
7) Check for errors using mean absolute error and mean squared error?
8) Get the accuracy for each of test and train?
9) Make a random data checking to see the effiency of the model?
10) Make a plot to see the difference between the actual and the predicted values?
11) Make two plot for each of the actual and the prediction?
12) Make a dataframe containing actual and prediction values ?
13) plot the dataframe using bar chart?
14) make a plot called pairplot to the original dataframe and the dataframe containing actual and prediction values ?
